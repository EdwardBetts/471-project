\subsection{New Model}
A new implementation, combining aspects of the MUCM and DAM consists of seting up the model similar to the DAM. Instead of a static cost per attack vector, use parameters for cost $C_{atk}{*}$ and $C_{def}{*}$ for the attacker and CactusCard, respectively.
\par
A second change is to select $X_{atk}$ vectors, where $X_{atk} \leq M_{atk}$ and chosen randomly. The probability of selecting one of the previous $M_{atk}$ moves is then given by
\[S_{atk} \prod_{i=1}^{X_{atk}} \frac{M_{atk}-i}{M_{atk}}\]
The probability of picking a move not in memory is still $1-S_{atk}$ (uniformly at random). The defense is the same, but replacing $S_{atk}$, $X_{atk}$, $M_{atk}$ with $S_{def}$, $X_{def}$, $M_{def}$
\par
This model is no longer limited in the same way as the DAM because it no longer selects only one attack vector in each round $N$. Instead, it selects a random number of attack vectors from vectors in its memory and from vectors not in its memory. This is a more complex model that better encapsulates the idea that attackers are not restricted to only one attack vector. It still relies on memory $M_{atk}$ and $M_{def}$, and it gives greater freedom to choose parameters $C_{atk}*$ and $C_{def}*$ which can better represent actual costs, rather than using a static value.
\par
A successful attack has a payoff for the attacker of \[SP_{atk} = B_{atk} -\sum_{v \in V_{atk}} C_{atk}*\]
For the defense, a successful attack has a payoff of \[SP_{def} = -B_{atk} -\sum_{v \in V_{def}} C_{def}*\].
\par
Unsuccessful attacks have payoffs \[UP_{atk} = -\sum_{v \in V_{atk}} C_{atk}*\] \[UP_{def} = -\sum_{v \in V_{def}} C_{def}*\] for the attacker and defender, respectively. In these payoffs, $V_{atk}$ and $V_{def}$ are each of the vectors used by the attacker and defender.
\par
The payoff matrix for this new model for a successful attack or successful defense relies on whether $V_{atk} \cap V_{def} = \emptyset$ for Case 1, or $V_{atk} \cap V_{def} \neq \emptyset$ for Case 2. Using the definition of independence of sets in a probability space $P(A \cap B) = P(A)\cdot P(B)$
\[P( V_{atk} \cap V_{def}) =\]
\[ V^2 ( S_{atk} - \prod_{i=1}^{X_{atk}} \frac{M_{atk}-i}{M_{atk}}) ( S_{def} - \prod_{j=1}^{X_{def}} \frac{M_{def}-j}{M_{def}}) \]

Combining these probabilities and the payoffs gives the payoff matrix for this new model.
